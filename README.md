# VoronConfig
A configuration of a Voron 2.2/2.4 3d printer using duet mainboard and reprap firmware 3.x.

This configuration is a fork from [Norbs config](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/legacy_printers/firmware_configurations/reprapfirmware/Norbs), with some small changes and some more
comments.
