# VoronConfig
A configuration of a Voron 2.2/2.4 3d printer using duet mainboard and reprap firmware 3.x.

This configuration is a fork from [Norbs config](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/legacy_printers/firmware_configurations/reprapfirmware/Norbs), with some small changes and some more comments in the files.

The printer itself is documented in this [document](./docs/printer.md).

As this is my very first 3d printer, I had some troubles on configuring it initially, I'm now in the progress of writing a [setup guide](./docs/setup.md) documenting the
tasks which brought me to success.
