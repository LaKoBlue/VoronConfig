; Auto calibration routine for an example delta printers
; Before running this, you should have set up your zprobe Z offset to suit your build, in the G31 command in config.g.
;you should use https://configurator.reprapfirmware.org/ to setup a correct bed.g file for your printer, what is below is just an example (and its commented out)

M117 Use https://configurator.reprapfirmware.org/ to set up your printer config

;M561						; clear any bed transform, otherwise homing may be at the wrong height
;G31 X0 Y0					; don't want any probe offset for this
;G28							; home the printer

;*** Remove the following line if your Z probe does not need to be deployed
;M98 Pdeployprobe.g			; deploy the mechanical Z probe

; The first time the mechanical probe is used after deployment, it gives slightly different results.
; So do an extra dummy probe here. The value stored gets overwritten later. You can remove this if you use an IR probe.

; Probe the bed and do 6- or 7-factor auto calibration
;G30 P0 X-73.6 Y-42.5 Z-99999	; X tower
;G30 P1 X0 Y-85 Z-99999			; between X and Y towers

;*** Remove the following line if your Z probe does not need to be retracted
;M98 Pretractprobe.g				; retract the mechanical Z probe

;G1 X0 Y0 Z150 F15000			; get the head out of the way of the bed
